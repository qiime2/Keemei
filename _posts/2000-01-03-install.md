## How do I install it?

Before installing Keemei you will need to create a free [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signUp) and log in. To install Keemei, click the image below to be taken to the Chrome Web Store:

<div style="text-align:center">
  <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/keemei/686675212969" target="_blank">
    <img src="img/web-store-badge-border.png" alt="Available in the G Suite Marketplace" />
  </a>
</div>
<p></p>

Click the blue button with the plus sign (+) to install the add-on. You will be prompted to give Keemei permissions that are required to operate. Once authorized, you're ready to start using Keemei!

Alternatively, you can install Keemei from within a Google Sheet by clicking `Add-ons > Get add-ons...` and searching for Keemei.

### Warning: please read!

Keemei displays validation status by modifying cell background colors and notes. If you use Keemei, **you will lose ALL existing cell background colors and notes in the active sheet.** There are future plans to minimize Keemei's impact on your Google Sheets, but for the time being this is a caveat of using Keemei.
